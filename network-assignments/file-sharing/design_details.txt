CONNECT
if server is full with 5 connections, reply (-1)FULL
if server sucessfully accept, reply 1, then the client need to send the hostname to server

REMOVE: if duplicate connection, reply -2
Duplication check move to client check, before real connection, check the connection list first. 
may need to use contains(xinu05 == xinu05.cs.purdue.edu)

Peer received flag code:
-1 -> close the connection, no feed back
file_size (> 0) -> uploading


everytime fd_set detect a receive request, first read sizeof(int), then read a whole buffer to get file name, then send back ok(1) to start real uploading
